Yesterday I have just complete the online assessment of booking.com, which I still feel a little bit frustrated - I could make lots of mistakes and stuck in such easy "algorithm" questions. During this process I could find lots of problems in my mindset, including but not limited to: 

1. Lack of the ability analyzing the corner cases, make changes to algorithm based on the corner cases
2. Lack of awareness of algorithms. Problems are often simple but cannot be disassembled and analyzed.
3. Not clear enough about the functions that the language can achieve

So due to all the above reasons, a new series - `Leetcode journal` is coming out, and in this journal I will record some solutions of typical leetcode questions, thought process, OA experience and some impression from doing leetcode. Another reason that I set this new series is that, since September, I have submitted tons of resumes one after another, but the situation is I always failed the OA stage after the resume is passed, which I can not catch the opportunities, and this is precisely because of the preparation is not enough. hopefully by recording every day, I can gradually form an structure of algorithm and data structure, with encouraging everyone who has the chance to read this blog.
