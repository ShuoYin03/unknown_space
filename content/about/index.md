## About Me
Hi there! my name is **_Shuo Yin_**, a software engineer and a student who currently studying computer science in the University of Manchester. I love learning and using different technologies, and I'm always on the road of discovring.

I am working as a part-time software engineer in |[Sportandmusic](https://sportandmusic.co.uk/), which I mainly focus on automation tasks using python and various APIs.

While I am free, I am a blog writer, a Vinyl lover, a song writer and sometimes a hacker (joining hackathons!!).

Feel free to connect me at Github and Linkedin, leave your thoughts in his blog or share your ideas by [writing me an email](mailto:shuoyin03@gmail.com).
