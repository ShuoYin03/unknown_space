The \u003ccode\u003egethostbyname\u003c/code\u003e method takes a domain name as a parameter,\nsends a query to the DNS server, and returns the corresponding IP address. (In modern\nsystems, this method is gradually being replaced by \u003ccode\u003egetaddrinfo\u003c/code\u003e, which supports a\nwider range of protocols.)
