      <description>Unlike SQL focus on data integrity and strict transactional semantics, NoSQL focus on all applications need elastic scaling and simple operations, which operating data in isolation, some characteristics of NoSQL are: expose a simple call-level interface or protocol, offer less strict transactional guarantees, replicate and distribute data over servers&amp;hellip; Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at NoSQL in this blog.
Types of NoSQL We could define NoSQL into three types: Key-Value, Document, and Wide Column.</description>

      <title>Advanced Distributed System - Batch Data and MapReduce</title>

      <description>Batch processing - a word describing tasks that can run without user interactions, or can be scheduled to run as resources permit. Batch data sets might be huge and need parallel processing. MapReduce is a programming model designed for batch processing, including two steps: &amp;lsquo;map&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;reduce&amp;rsquo;.
MapReduce - &amp;lsquo;Map&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Reduce&amp;rsquo; Some concepts Job is the unit of work to be performed, it could consist of several map and reduce tasks.</description>

      <description>What are resources? All stuffs needed for maintaining the run of a system are called resources, such as hardware(CPU, storage, network links), software(web services), and datasets. Applications need to share the resources, and we need to consider how to optimize their use with respect to resources available and resources requested by different applications.
One example demonstrating a trade-off between time, price and storage resource is that, we could make a software parallelisable and run it with different expensive processors, but it uses lots of storage because large amount of data are processing at the same time.</description>

      <description>In a distributed application, we always have to consider the impact of faults and solutions of how we can solve it while balancing the cost, response time and other performances.
Type of Failures First of all, letâ€™s have a look at what type of faults do have.
Omission failures
The server fails to respond/receive to incoming requests and fail to send messages Timing failures
The server fails to respond within a certain time Response failures</description>

      <title>Advanced Distributed System - Performance Modelling</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always good to test the performance of distributed applications to ensure it meets the target, and today we&amp;rsquo;ll learn what is a model and how to build a model to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advanced Distributed System - Big data</title>
      <link>https://shuoyin03.github.io/2023/11/06/distributed-system-big-data/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a shared nothing infrastructure, data storage, update, access and processing takes place across a collection of networked machines. To enhance the performance, processing needs to be take place in parallel, which we have to distribute data, and that&amp;rsquo;s partition. This article will gives an rough idea of partition techniques and details needs to be consider.&lt;/p&gt;
