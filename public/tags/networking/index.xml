      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article will explain the series of processes that occur after a URL is entered into a browser and a query is initiated. The content is based on the book How the Internet Connects with some additional clarifications and expansions for better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;dns---from-domain-name-to-ip-address&#34;&gt;DNS - From Domain Name to IP Address&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the browser receives a user&amp;rsquo;s URL request, the first step is to resolve the domain name into an IP address. This is because domain names are easier for humans to remember and are more readable, but computers need IP addresses to identify the location of other machines on the network. When we enter a website in the browser and press the Enter key, the browser will first call a method named &lt;code&gt;gethostbyname&lt;/code&gt; from the system&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;Socket API&lt;/code&gt; (Socket is an interface provided by the operating system for network communication. It offers a series of methods for interacting with the network protocol stack within the OS). The &lt;code&gt;gethostbyname&lt;/code&gt; method takes a domain name as a parameter, sends a query to the DNS server, and returns the corresponding IP address. (In modern systems, this method is gradually being replaced by &lt;code&gt;getaddrinfo&lt;/code&gt;, which supports a wider range of protocols.) The DNS server stores the mappings between domain names and IP addresses, and its task is to handle query requests from clients. The query parameters typically include three elements:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
