      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a shared nothing infrastructure, data storage, update, access and processing takes place across a collection of networked machines. To enhance the performance, processing needs to be take place in parallel, which we have to distribute data, and that&amp;rsquo;s partition. This article will gives an rough idea of partition techniques and details needs to be consider.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In this article, we are going to look at the formal definition of Turing Machine and the therom with it.
Introduction of turing machine The picture below is a multi-tape turing machine Definition In a formal definition, a turing machine could be define as a quintuple:
M = [ K, Σ, Q, q0, T ]
K ≥ 2 (number of tapes) Σ is a non-empty, finite set (alphabet) Q is a non-empty, finite set (set of states) q0 ∈ Q (initial state) T is a set of transitions (for K, Σ and Q) Symbol A symbol is an element of which means blank and start separately.</description>
