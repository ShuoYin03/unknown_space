      <description>What are resources? All stuffs needed for maintaining the run of a system are called resources, such as hardware(CPU, storage, network links), software(web services), and datasets. Applications need to share the resources, and we need to consider how to optimize their use with respect to resources available and resources requested by different applications.
One example demonstrating a trade-off between time, price and storage resource is that, we could make a software parallelisable and run it with different expensive processors, but it uses lots of storage because large amount of data are processing at the same time.</description>

      <description>In a distributed application, we always have to consider the impact of faults and solutions of how we can solve it while balancing the cost, response time and other performances.
Type of Failures First of all, let’s have a look at what type of faults do have.
Omission failures
The server fails to respond/receive to incoming requests and fail to send messages Timing failures
The server fails to respond within a certain time Response failures</description>

      <title>Natural Language Processing - POS Tagging</title>

      <description>In this article we will have a look at POS tagging, what is it? How do we apply it to NLP tasks?
POS POS - &amp;ldquo;Part of Speech&amp;rdquo;, represent a linguistic category, defined the syntactic or morphological behavior of words. “Traditional” categories contains 8 tags, they are:
verb None Adverb Adjective Interjection Pronoun Preposition Conjunction The previous 5 categories are called the open word classes, which means that these types always have a large amount of vocabularies and new words could be added into these categories.</description>

      <description>In this article we will have a look at how to represent texts in data forms for further nlp processes.
BoW Representation BoW - &amp;ldquo;Bag of words&amp;rdquo;, should be the simplest model, which reduce each document into a bag of words. BoW is an efficient method which nowadays lots of NLP system is using it. However, there are some question we should think of while using it, such as:</description>

      <description>In this article, we are going to look at general steps of text pre-processing. Tokenization Word-Based Tokenization Tokenization is the first step of text pre-processing, it is to split a bunch of text into a list of tokens. As an example, we could split “a cat on a pat” to [“a”, “cat”, “on”,</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always good to test the performance of distributed applications to ensure it meets the target, and today we&amp;rsquo;ll learn what is a model and how to build a model to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Propositional Logic Satisfiability Definitions We call $P = \lbrace p_1, p_2, &amp;hellip; \rbrace $ as propositional letters. Every element in $P$ is a formula. If $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ are formulas, then the following equations are formulas, too. $$(¬\psi_1), (\psi_1 ∨ \psi_2), (\psi_1 ∧ \psi_2), (\psi_1 → \psi_2)$$
An assignment is a function $\theta: P → \lbrace T, F\rbrace$, for example: In a simple way, an assignment is like a machine running a logic equation and excute a result.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction to Time and Space Definitions Consider there is a turing machine M with alphabet Σ, and g is a function N → N, we say M runs in time g and runs in space g with at most g(|x|) steps and g(|x|) squares with a finite x many Strings. If there is a language L over some alphabet, we say L runs in Time(g) and Space(g) such that there is a deterministic turing machine M recognizing L runs in time and space g.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a shared nothing infrastructure, data storage, update, access and processing takes place across a collection of networked machines. To enhance the performance, processing needs to be take place in parallel, which we have to distribute data, and that&amp;rsquo;s partition. This article will gives an rough idea of partition techniques and details needs to be consider.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In this article, we are going to look at the formal definition of Turing Machine and the therom with it.
Introduction of turing machine The picture below is a multi-tape turing machine Definition In a formal definition, a turing machine could be define as a quintuple:
M = [ K, Σ, Q, q0, T ]
K ≥ 2 (number of tapes) Σ is a non-empty, finite set (alphabet) Q is a non-empty, finite set (set of states) q0 ∈ Q (initial state) T is a set of transitions (for K, Σ and Q) Symbol A symbol is an element of which means blank and start separately.</description>
